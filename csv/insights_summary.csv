Enrolment Trend Analysis,Chart 01 (Enrolment Trend),Total enrolments peaked in 2025-01 with 1366494 registrations. Current trend indicates declining pattern.,Helps forecast resource allocation and staffing needs for upcoming quarters.
Age Distribution in Enrolment,Chart 02 (Age-wise Stacked Bar),"Adults (18+) dominate enrolment at 4.4%, while children (0-5) represent only 60.0%. This reflects late-stage adult enrolment.",Indicates potential for targeted outreach programs in underrepresented demographics.
Update Pattern: Demographic vs Biometric,Chart 04 (Demo vs Bio Line Chart),Biometric updates (55546293) outnumber demographic updates (32471759) by 1.7x. Bio updates are more resource-intensive.,Biometric infrastructure requires more robust device allocation and technician training.
Operational Stress Concentration,"Chart 06, 07 (Stress Heatmap & Ranking)",15 districts classified as 'High Stress' with UER > 33.70. Top district: Uttar Bastar Kanker (UER: 1570.90).,"These districts need immediate support: additional staff, device calibration, or process optimization."
Anomaly Detection & Early Warnings,"Chart 08 (Anomaly Scatter), anomaly_table.csv",0 anomalous district-month records (0.00% of data) detected. Most are biometric spikes beyond 2 standard deviations.,"Early warning system for unusual patterns—could signal system issues, device failures, or operational changes."
3-Month Forecast for Biometric Updates,Chart 09 (Forecast Trend),"Linear trend shows decreasing biometric demand (slope: -1632066/month). Forecast next 3 months: -5981168, -7613234, -9245301 updates.","Enables proactive planning for hardware procurement, maintenance windows, and seasonal staffing adjustments."
Geographic Concentration of Activity,Merged dataset aggregation,"Top 3 states: Uttar Pradesh (557687), Bihar (302969), Madhya Pradesh (232899). These 3 states account for 41.5% of national enrolments.",Resource distribution strategy—prioritize infrastructure in high-activity zones; monitor slower regions for bottlenecks.
