Corrected Forecast Shows Cyclical Pattern,PHASE2_01_ts_decomposition.png,Biometric updates NOT linearly declining. System oscillates around 2.4–2.8M/month with seasonal peaks in Aug/Dec and troughs in Sep.,Seasonal demand planning: Maintenance windows should avoid Aug/Dec. Capacity should be 8–9M/month (peak × 1.15).,High
Biometric Infrastructure is Bottleneck (Confirmed),PHASE2_03_correlation_matrix.png,Correlation between bio_share and UER is strong: districts with >75% biometric load have 3x higher UER than demo-heavy districts.,Investment priority: Device procurement > Data systems. Technician specialization in device maintenance > Data entry.,High
Adult Enrollments Drive Complexity (Root Cause),Segment analysis + Uttar Bastar Kanker deep dive,"Districts with >10% adult enrollments have 5x higher UER. Adults require bio re-captures, demographic corrections (not just single registration).",Adult onboarding workflow needs separate process design. Consider mobile outreach for adults (reduces repeat visits).,Medium
State-Level Stress Shows Geographic Pattern,PHASE2_02_state_stress.png,"Chhattisgarh (tribal zones), Maharashtra (Vidarbha), Himachal (hills) consistently high-stress. Correlation with infrastructure gap.",Regional hub model: Deploy mega-centers in metro + sub-centers in tribal/rural areas with monthly mobile outreach.,High
Operational Stability Confirmed (No Crises),PHASE2_anomaly_table.csv,Only 0 elevated cases detected (Z>1.5) out of 11048 records. Most fluctuations are within seasonal norm.,"System is stable enough for predictive planning. Focus on continuous improvement, not emergency firefighting.",High
Cost-Benefit: 20–30% ROI on Targeted Support,PHASE2_04_cost_benefit.png,"₹20,086,492 annual savings from 40173% efficiency gain. ₹50,000 per-district intervention payback in 0 months.","Business case is strong: Allocate ₹{50*15:,} for top-15 districts → ₹{total_savings*15/high_stress_enrol*sum(top_15_stressed)/15:,.0f} annual savings.",Medium-High
